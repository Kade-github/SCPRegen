# SCPRegen
This was a simple plugin I made which just adds HP Regeneration to SCP's Health.

## Config
```
scpr_regenerate: true - Enable or Disable the plugin
scpr_regenerate_timer: 5000 - The timer between regen (In miliseconds)
scpr_regenerate_hp: 60 - The amount of HP a SCP will regen.
```

## Guide
Just simply add the .dll and then add the config options you need and configure them to your needs!
